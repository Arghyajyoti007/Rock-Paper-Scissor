### Rock Paper Scissors Game

This project is a classic **Rock Paper Scissors game** implemented in Python. It allows a user to play against the computer.

The game starts by welcoming the player and presenting them with options to choose from: **Rock (1), Paper (2), or Scissors (3)**. The player's choice is taken as input, and the computer makes a random selection from the same options.

Both the user's and the computer's choices are then displayed visually using **ASCII art** representations of rock, paper, and scissors. The game logic determines the winner based on the traditional rules of Rock Paper Scissors:

* Rock beats Scissors
* Paper beats Rock
* Scissors beats Paper

Finally, the game announces whether the player **won or lost** the round.
